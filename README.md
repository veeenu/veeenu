## Hey 👋

I'm Andrea! But for some reason you might know me as [John](https://twitch.tv/johndisandonato) instead.

I'm a jack of all trades with a passion for writing simple and performant code.

If you get distracted for a second, I **will** rewrite your entire codebase in Rust.

Here's some of my open source work you might like:
